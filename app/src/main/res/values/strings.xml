    <string name="about_tedx">In the spirit of “ideas worth spreading,” TED created TEDx, a program of local, self-organised, independent events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, a collection of TED Talk videos and live speakers combine to spark deep discussions and connections.</string>
    <string name="about_ted">TED is a global platform with an annual conference that brings together the world’s leading thinkers, social entrepreneurs and change makers to share ideas that matter in any discipline—technology, entertainment, design, science, environment, business. The talks at the conference, “TED Talks,” are then made available for free online at TED.com. Over 100 million people view TED videos.</string>

    <string name="about_tedxdtu">Re-established in the year 2015, our team has worked tirelessly to deliver one of the highest quality TEDx events in India. Our previous event, held on the 18th of March 2017, was witnessed by an audience of 150+, consisting of designers, entrepreneurs, professionals, technology enthusiasts and motivated students alike; the top faculty of Delhi Technological University and representatives from various media organisations.
        \n \nThe organising team put together a revolutionary line-up of speakers consisting of artists, celebrities, industrialists, visionaries and motivators who inspired thousands of people with their words of change.</string>
    <string name="theme">The solution to a seemingly unsolvable problem. The entrance of a \'god\' to bring an end to an unresolvable climax. The trump card. Referring to the introduction of these ideas, our theme, \'Deus Ex Machina\' aims to coalesce with the very principle of TEDx– Ideas Worth Spreading. With issues arising in every field, our goal is to bring forth a series of revolutionary ideas which break the generic glass ceilings, and bring forth interesting outcomes. Rather than being unexpected twists in the scenarios, we aim to foster the generation of solutions which have been staring us in the face all along, and invoke conversations of its implications in the modern scenario.</string>
